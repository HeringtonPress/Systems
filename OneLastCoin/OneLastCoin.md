# OLC Core
## Saves
When doing anything with an interesting chance of failure you roll a d12, trying to roll higher then 8. A tasks difficulty may grant you a bonus or penalty to your roll.
## Gambling Dice
To gamble dice decide the size of the pool and then roll all of them, losing any dice that show the highest 2 results of that die.

## Class
[Classes](OLCClasses.md) are broken up into Templates which are denoted as A, B, C, and D. You begin play with the A template of a Class and as you progress you can unlock more. When you buy additional templates with Experience you may take the next alphabetical template in a class you have or take A in a new class that makes sense for your character. A character may never have more the 4 templates, though you could swap two templates at the cost of buying a new one.

You gain access to all the parts of a class when you have that letter template. For example. Laius is a level 1 Slayer, meaning he get both Critical Hits and Attack Surge. 
## Background
Who you were before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to add the Background value to a Save.

You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language for every 2 Cunning above 8. If your Cunning is raised you can learn a new Tongue.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
- **LIGHTLENT**: The tongue only travels through shadow.
## Inventory Slots

| Can contain:   | 1 Stress   | 1 medium weapon  |
| Bundle of rope |  arrows | 1/2 heavy weapon |
| 3 rations      | 1 treasure | 3 light weapons  |

You begin play with 10 Slots and 2 additional QUICK-DRAW Slots. You gain an additional slot whenever you gain a level, up to 4th level. Small Items can be drawn from any slot as a QUICK-DRAW when held in a slot alone.
## Hit Points - Grit and Flesh
**Grit** is "don't get hit" points. It represents your ability to mitigate actual harm. You use these up first.

**Flesh** represents physical damage, your blood is flowing. You take Flesh damage after you've used up all your Grit--or take damage in such a way that you can't get out of the way, e.g., falling onto spikes totally bypasses your Grit and goes straight onto your Flesh.

Characters have a number of Flesh points equal to 6. Characters have a variable amount of Grit based on what they eat (see Nutrients below).  

You die when they have less Flesh points then -Half max.  

If you're Flesh is in the negatives but you're not dead, a character can use a First Aid Kit to heal you to 0 Flesh.
## Cooking Feasts
A **feast** is a moment of actual rest in the middle of hostile and hungry darkness. Depending on the make up of the feast, characters might gain Grit, Magic, Brain, or Brawn Dice. See Nutrients below.  

To create a feast, you require:
- **Two unique ingredients**
- **One portion per character**

In addition, you must fulfill **two** of the following four criteria:
- Fire
- Water
- Cooking gear
- Spices

A feast must be prepared and then immediately consumed as part of a Camp Action.

Each monster eaten provides a certain amount of portions. A rat yields about one portion. A minotaur yields about eight. A dragon could feast upwards of fifty adventurers.   

The GM adds together any nutritional benefits from the two ingredients used to make a feast and tell the players the totals for each nutrient category (see below). Decimals  are rounded as god intended.  

**A nutrient has a maximum score of 5.** No matter the combination of ingredients, a nutrient can't go above 5 for any one particular feast.

**Example:** After a battle with a basilisk, the party cooks an omelette out of the basilisk's eggs, basilisk bacon, and sliced shambling mound. They cook the omelette in Senshi's wok (cooking gear), flavor it with salt, pepper, and ketchup (spices), over a fire. This fulfills 3 out of 4 of the cooking requirements.
### Nutrients
Characters grow and become stronger if they eat well-balanced, healthful, and magical meals. 

Each feast has four stats, called **Nutrients.** 
- **Energy** determines how many calories a feast has. This nutrient reinforces a character's Grit.
- **Minerals** provide needed magical energy. This nutrient refills a character's Magic Dice. 
- **Vitamins** are good for your brain. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brain Dice. 
- **Protein** builds strong bones and muscles. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brawn Dice.

Eating a **ration** grants 1d4 in one nutrient. 

#### Food Dice
Food Dice (FD) are either d4s, d6s or d8s. 
- If the feast contained **mundane** animals or plants, the Food Dice are equal to d4s. 
- If the feast contained no mundane animals or plants, **only exotic** ingredients, the Food Dice are equal to d6s. 
- If the feast contained extraordinarily **magical** ingredients, like a dragon or an angel, the Food Dice are equal to d8s. 

#### Energy
The more energy a character has, the more resilient they are in the face of adversity.

**If the players benefit from energy:** After the feast, characters roll as many FD as the feast's energy rank. The character's current Grit score is immediately replaced with the new total, if it is higher. 
#### Minerals
Minerals connect a character to the natural world and the ebb of mana. As a magic-user casts spells, their internal reserves of minerals becomes quickly depleted.

**If the players benefit from minerals:** They gain magic dice (MD) of the same die type and number as the feast's mineral rank. A character can hold a maximum amount of magic dice equal to their number of Templates. These MD are held until spent and expended through casting spells.
#### Vitamins
Vitamins produce a healthful effect on one's metabolism, reasoning, and cognitive capabilities. By eating foods rich in vitamins, characters benefit from increased memory and logical reasoning capabilities.

**If the players benefit from vitamins:** They gain Brain Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Vitamin rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly mental Save.

#### Proteins
Proteins are important for building muscle and reducing soreness after exertion. Eating foods rich in proteins promotes physical development. 

**If the players benefit from proteins:** They gain Brawn Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Protein rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly physical Save.

## Experience
You gain experience through indulging in the spoils of your quests and exploration. Gain 1XP for every Gold Piece (GP) spent.

| Level |  EXP  | Templates | Slots |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|
|   1   |   -   |     1     |  10   |
|   2   | 2000  |     2     |  11   |
|   3   | 4000  |     3     |  12   |
|   4   | 6000  |     4     |  13   |
|  5+   | +4000 |           |  14   |

## Spellcasting and Magic
It takes 1 camp action to move any number of spells between your brain and a scroll, spellbook, or wand.

To cast a spell you must have access to one, typically from a scroll or spellbook. Select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to Gamble, roll them, and add the numbers together. Most spells depend on the number of (dice) invest and the (sum) they show. If you roll doubles, see the Mishap section. If you roll triples, see the Doom section.
### Spellbooks
A solid volume, with thick vellum pages and a sturdy cover. Each school produces its own style. Inside, special runes and symbols trap spells inside cages of crystallized thought. Each book contains 5 spell slots. Spellbooks are waterproof, acid- and fire-resistant. Each book is worth 100gp even if it contains no spells.
### Scrolls
A page from a spellbook, effectively, but with some extra magic built in. If you cast a spell from a scroll or spellbook, without moving it to a spellslot first,  you can burn the scroll adding +1d6 MD to your roll gamble. This MD does not return to your pool. A blank scroll is worth 10gp.
### Wands
Wands are like scrolls customized for rapid reuse. A wand has it's own pool of MD and can hold one spell. You can gamble these MD when you cast a spell with a wand, whether it is the stored spell or not. The Wands MD are always lost when gambled.

You can choose to invest MD into the wand. You roll the MD and take damage equal to the result. The MD invested in the wand is permanently added to the wand's MD bank until spent. This process takes a dungeon turn.

Most wands can only accept 4 banked MD and 1 spell. Larger wands, called staves, can hold up to 6 banked MD and up to 3 spells. Wands are traditionally made from the wood of lightning-struck trees.
### Mishaps
If you roll doubles while casting a spell, roll on your school's mishap table. Unless otherwise specified, the spell still works. Magic is dangerous; this was just a hiccup or misfire.  
### Dooms
If you roll triples while casting a spell, one of your school's Dooms takes effect. Each school has 3 dooms. The third doom is invariable fatal or worse. All wizards walk a dangerous path. The burn their souls like candles, and in doing so, court damnation.

You suffer your dooms in chronological order. Dooms may only be reversed with the most difficult of tasks i.e. Bathing in fresh dragon's blood, consume the heart of a fae prince, or signing a devilish pact with some questionable fine print.

## Exploring
### Watches
Days spent Traveling are split into 6 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
### Actions
**MOVE** a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving Fatigue based on the difficulty of the terrain.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

**SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with direction.

**SCOUT** Spend a watch patrolling the borders of a Hex. See the terrain of neighboring hexes.

**CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

**MAKE CAMP**. Watches taken in camps don’t roll Omens.

**FEAST** Spend a watch cooking and eating a feast.

**DELVE** Unless obviously more time is taken, Delving into and exiting a dungeon takes a Watch.
### Vehicles
Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.
## Delving
### The Underclock
It starts at 20 when you walk into a dungeon.  When it reaches 0, an Encounter happens.

You will periodically roll a six-sided Underworld die and subtract it from the Underclock whenever the party expends time or noise.  Examples of actions that provoke an Underclock Roll:
- Exploring a new room (including long hallways).
- Moving through 3 already-explored rooms.
- Lingering or searches.
- Making noise (e.g. kicking down a door).

NOTE: the noise of combat doesn't normally contribute to the Underclock.

Some more facts about the Underclock:
- If the Underclock drops below 0, an Encounter is triggered.  After the Encounter resolves, the Underclock resets to 20.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 0 exactly, it resets to 3.  The Underworld's attention is elsewhere, momentarily.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 3, a Omen occurs.

### Confront the Clock
At any point while Delving a party can prepare for a coming encounter. Skip the Underclock to -1 and resolve everything as normal though the party gets the drop on the encounter.
### Resting
While eating a ration is just a turn. Resting and cooking a feast takes some time.
You’ll have to roll some Underclock Rolls.
- If you are resting in the middle of a well-traveled location, make 3 rolls.
- If you are in a secret room that no one else knows about, you don’t need to make any rolls.
- Everything in between is either 1 or 2 rolls.

### Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for. Without enough light for everyone, roll the Underclock die twice and keep the higher result. With no light at all the die size is increased as well.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
### Doors
Opening a stuck door is a save with -4 by base, though this may increase if the door is heavy, large, and/or obstructed. Using a prybar gives a +4 to the save.

Trying to force a stuck door open results in a Underclock roll.

You may also choose to break it down. This requires no save but rolls upwards of 3 Underclock dice.
### Locks
Requires Thieves’ tools and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt rolls the Underclock die.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.
### Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Save with a penalty equal to your total filled slots, excluding Quick-Slots, and a bonus equal to unfilled slots.

When attempting to sneak as a group, one member of the group Saves. The CR is equal to the total filled Slots of the group, divided by half of the group, rounded up.
### Degeneration and Leaving the Dungeon
The Underworld hoards its treasures.  It hates the idea of its gold returning to the surface.

Whenever you leave the dungeon, the dungeon degenerates.  Things may change, the dungeon may restock, but most critically, the treasure depletes.

Every time the players exit to the outside, the biggest treasure pile in the dungeon loses 20% of its value, stolen away by agents of the Underworld.

The exception to this is if you have a camp setup outside the dungeon you may make a pitstop. Roll the Dungeon die once when exciting and again when re-entering though these rolls may never lower the clock beyond 3.
## Fighting
### Rounds
Each Round the Guide describes what it appears like the monsters are going to do. Save against the number of filled slots you have, with a bonus for every empty slot, to act first.
### On Your Turn
You take two actions per round.

Move to an adjacent zone, Strike, trip, get in front of an ally, fetch an item, or raise a shield. You may only Strike once. Get creative.
### Attacking
Make an attack against an enemy, rolling damage based on the weapon you are wielding and dealing it to your opponent.
### Defending
When getting attacked. You may Gamble your Armor Dice to subtract the result of all your dice from the damage taken. Shields may also be gambled, notably you can resolve a shields gamble before gambling armor.
### Impaired vs Bolstered
Attacks may become Impaired by circumstances within the fiction. I.e. fighting with a polearm in a narrow tunnel, using a knife against an acidic ooze, firing a bow into melee, swinging your sword while laying prone. Similarly some attacks may have reason to be more effective then they regularly are.

When making an attack while impaired your damage dice become d4s. While Bolstered add a d6 to the damage roll.
### Fleeing
If the party agrees to flee then bar dire circumstances they escape. Each character that escaped suffers 2d6 Fatigue. They may attempt to throw treasure, food, or obstacles in the way of the enemy to avoid Fatigue. Fleeing in this way leaves any fallen or captured ally behind, unless you are holding the fallen and have the slots to do so. The average person is 6 Slots and dragging allows you to ignore their encumbrance.

#### Wielding Weapons
Weapons fill slots equal to the amount of dice they deal. With the exception of Small Weapons.
##### Weapon Tags
**Long** weapons require both hands and are Impaired in confined environments.
**Slow** weapons take an action to ready after an attack. They are also Long.
